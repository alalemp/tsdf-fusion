# Volumetric TSDF Fusion of Multiple Depth Maps

![Teaser](teaser.jpg?raw=true)

CUDA/C++ code to fuse multiple registered depth maps into a projective truncated signed distance function (TSDF) voxel volume, which can then be used to create high quality 3D surface meshes and point clouds. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.

This repository is a part of [Andy's Code Collection](http://andyzeng.github.io/).

## Change Log
* **Nov. 1, 2017.** Bug fix: `tsdf2mesh.m` now properly generates a mesh in camera coordinates instead of voxel coordinates.
* **Oct. 30, 2017.** Notice: changed default weight threshold for `SaveVoxelGrid2SurfacePointCloud` in demo code to enable creating point cloud visualizations with only one depth frame.
* **Aug. 30, 2017.** Bug fix: remove deprecated offsets from surface distance compute during integration.

## Requirements
 * NVIDA GPU with [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) support
 * [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (tested with OpenCV 2.4.11)

## HPC Cluster Settings
```bashrc (add to .bashrc)
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-8.0
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```

## Demo
This demo fuses 50 registered depth maps from directory `data/rgbd-frames` into a projective TSDF voxel volume, and creates a 3D surface point cloud `tsdf.ply`, which can be visualized with a 3D viewer like [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/).

```shell
./compile.sh # compiles demo executable
./demo # 3D point cloud saved to tsdf.ply and voxel grid saved to tsdf.bin
```

[Optional] This demo also saves the computed voxel volume into a binary file `tsdf.bin`. Run the following script in Matlab to create a 3D surface mesh `mesh.ply`, which can be visualized with [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/).

```matlab
tsdf2mesh; % 3D mesh saved to mesh.ply
```
